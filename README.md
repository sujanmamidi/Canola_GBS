# Canola_GBS
## GBS data for Canola ((Brassica napus L.) Diversity samples (n=366)
This data here are the SNP generated for diversity collection of Canola in USA in Hapmap format. This data was generated at North Dakota State University, Fargo, USA. This data (or a subset) has been used to publish a few manuscripts (see below). Feel free to contact us (Md [dot] M [dot] Rahman [at] ndsu [dot] edu OR sujan [dot] mamidi [at] gmail [dot] com, if you need more information on this data. If using this data, citation of any of these papers is appreciated.  

# Methods:
Genomic DNA was extracted from a collection of 366 individuals representing the entire canola diversity available at North Dakota State University. These samples were sequenced using a Genotype-By-Sequencing protocol (Elshire et al. 2011). Briefly, the samples were digested with ApekI enzyme. Illumina GA-II sequencer was used to sequence the sample as 100 bp single end reads from size selection of 300–700 bp fragments. Sequence alignments were performed using BWA-mem (Li et al., 2013) and SNP calling using VarScan (Liu et al., 2013), with a minimum depth of 3. FastPHASE (Scheet and Stephens, 2006) was used to impute the missing alleles. Finally, 42,275 SNPs were obtained that have a MAF > 0.05.
